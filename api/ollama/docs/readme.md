- Architectural documentation
- Integration guides and tutorials
- Any documentation beyond inline code documentation

## Responsibility Table

| Entity | Responsibility | Reason |
|--------|---------------|--------|

## Documentation Guidelines

- **Feature Documentation**: New features should document their design decisions here
- **Architectural Documentation**: Major architectural changes should be documented with rationale
- **Integration Guides**: Complex integration scenarios should have dedicated documentation files
- **API Documentation**: High-level API overviews and usage patterns belong here; detailed API docs belong in source code
- **Collection Organization**: All documentation must be organized into appropriate design collections (operation/, pattern/, api/, etc.)
