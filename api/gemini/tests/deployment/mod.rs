//! Model Deployment Integration Tests for Gemini API Client
//!
//! These tests verify model deployment capabilities including:
//! - Deployment workflow management and lifecycle operations
//! - Configuration validation and builder patterns
//! - State monitoring and change notifications
//! - Scaling and resource management
//! - Deployment strategies (Rolling, Blue-Green, Canary)
//! - Error handling and cleanup operations
//!
//! All tests use real API tokens and make actual deployment operations where possible.

// Import shared test utilities from common module
