# docs

## Purpose

This directory contains supplementary documentation for the Claude API client. Files here provide deep-dive technical documentation, analysis reports, and reference materials that extend beyond the primary readme.

## Organization Principles

- Documentation files use descriptive, lowercase snake_case names
- Technical deep-dives separated from main readme
- Analysis reports and frameworks kept as reference materials
- Policy and security documentation centralized here
