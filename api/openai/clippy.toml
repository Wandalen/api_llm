# Custom clippy configuration for api_openai
# Extends workspace-level configuration with project-specific rules

# === Threshold Configuration ===

# Allow more arguments for API methods and builder patterns
too-many-arguments-threshold = 7

# Allow more lines in functions for comprehensive API handlers
too-many-lines-threshold = 150

# Allow complex types for comprehensive API coverage
type-complexity-threshold = 250

# Allow larger enum variants for API response structures
enum-variant-size-threshold = 300

# === Behavioral Configuration ===

# Allow certain patterns that might not follow all Rust conventions
# but are necessary for API client functionality

# Allow single character lifetime names in generics
# Allow assertions in non-test code for API validation
# Allow default trait access patterns for API objects

# === Documentation Requirements ===

# Require documentation for error handling in public APIs
# This helps users understand potential failure modes

# === Performance and Security ===

# Focus on preventing common performance and security issues
# while allowing flexibility needed for API client patterns

# === Testing Configuration ===

# Allow testing patterns that might be restricted in production code
# Tests need comprehensive coverage and may require complex setups
